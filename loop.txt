Here are 10 JavaScript loop questions ranging from basic to mid-level:  

### **Basic Questions**  
1. **Print numbers from 1 to 10**  
   - Write a loop that prints numbers from `1` to `10` using a `for` loop.  

2. **Sum of first N natural numbers**  
   - Take an input `n` and find the sum of all natural numbers from `1` to `n` using a loop.  

3. **Print even numbers from 1 to 20**  
   - Use a `while` loop to print all even numbers between `1` and `20`.  

4. **Reverse counting from 10 to 1**  
   - Print numbers from `10` to `1` using a `for` loop.  

5. **Multiplication table of a given number**  
   - Take an input number and print its multiplication table up to `10` using a loop.  

### **Mid-Level Questions**  
6. **Count digits in a number**  
   - Given a number, count how many digits it has using a loop.  
   - Example: `num = 12345`, output = `5`.  

7. **Factorial of a number**  
   - Calculate the factorial of a number `n` using a loop.  
   - Example: `5! = 5 Ã— 4 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1 = 120`.  

8. **Reverse a number**  
   - Take a number as input and reverse it using a loop.  
   - Example: `1234` â†’ `4321`.  

9. **Check if a number is prime**  
   - Write a loop that checks whether a given number is prime or not.  

10. **Fibonacci series**  
   - Print the first `n` Fibonacci numbers using a loop.  
   - Example: `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...`
